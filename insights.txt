-Regression to predict 9 variables
-Take care of missing data in topics
-Evaluation = L2 prediction accuracy (use loss function as mentined in error metric.pdf)
-health_physunh and health_mentunh can range from 0 to 31
-check range for health_aamort
-p>n (features are more than n, PCA or regularization)
-multi-task learning
-2 very differnt features
-divide data into training and cross-validation
-is county number an input feature?  
-look into the FIPS code notation, what each number stand for?
-look into 'cell mode' in MATLAB
-look into misclassified data carefully. Are they outliers that should be removed from the training set? Is there a new feature you need to add to account for these hard examples?
-incase of doing Multiclass classification, account for expectation of the data
-handle new features in test, that do not occur in training. (like new words). One solution to this is to run PCA on the entire dataset. 
-try feature selection - L0 - stagewise, stepwise, streamwiswe...
-ensenble on many levels - combining different types of features, 9 different models for each output class, different models for all classes together...
-maybe standardize the data? if using regularization penalty is most likely required.
-for text data try easy features first
-the outputs are massively correalted
-ensemble of multiple models should give the best model.
-rural vs urban counties will show very different behaviours.
